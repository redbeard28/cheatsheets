Dash Cheat Sheets 
===========

The aim of this repo (forked from [kapeli source](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatsheets)) is to have the possibility to make my own cheats sheets and keep updated the originals from the community.

# Make Your Own

Cheat sheets are generated using [cheatset](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme). Check out cheatset's [README](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset#readme) for instructions on how to make your own cheat sheet.

I will make it easy to you !
